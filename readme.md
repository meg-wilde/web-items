# Web Project API

This is a simple RESTful API for managing a list of web project items.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Run the file on your local machine using npm install and npm start

3. Use the localhost URL in Postman to test the API:

- Get All Web Items: Send a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api.

- Add a New Web Item: Send a POST request to http://localhost:8080/api with a JSON body.

- Update a Web Item: Send a PUT request to http://localhost:8080/api/{id} with a JSON body. `{id}` is the id number you want to update.

- Delete a Web Item: Send a DELETE request to http://localhost:8080/api/{id} where `{id}` is the id number you want to delete

Explore the API and verify the functionality.
